"It\'s a great overall mass builder," says White. "These are really good for strengthening your core and increasing overall strength due to the stability aspect of this movement." Start with your hardest move to ensure you\'ve got the core strength to maintain perfect form.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"seated-dumbbell-press",title:"Seated Dumbbell Press",description:'Re-rack your barbell and grab a pair of dumbbells, because they\'re all you\'ll need for the rest of the workout. Next grab a bench; sitting down helps isolate the shoulder motion. "These are really good for not only handling a lot of weight, but also having the freedom of using dumbbells," White tells MH. "You can bring them nice and low to get a really full range of motion." Take a load off your feet and put a load on your delts.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"arnold-press",title:"Arnold Press",description:'Named for their Mr Universe-winning, Predator-killing inventor, the rotating motion at the end of this exercise hits more than the standard press to fill out that v-shape. "It\'s nice way to do a conventional press while adjusting position to target the anterior deltoids," says White.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"lateral-raise",title:"Lateral Raise",description:"The slower you can perform these raises, the more they'll hurt \u2013 and the better you're going to look. \"Lateral raises are perfect for isolating the medial part of the deltoid,\" White explains. \"They're more commonly used with a lighter weight and higher reps.\" You'll still be gritting your teeth by the end of the third set.",muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"bent-over-reverse-fly",title:"Bent over reverse fly",description:'This lateral raise variant will hit you where it hurts, working both shoulders and back. White loves them. "It\'s one of the best exercises for targeting the posterior deltoid. For more focus on the movement and less on stabilising things, try placing a bench at 45 degrees and perform this movement lying face down on it." Atlas-level shoulders are on the way.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"upright-row",title:"Upright row",description:'Another great mass builder," says White. "Get your elbows higher than your hands for a peak contraction of the deltoid. The upright row also targets the traps." Compound moves like this benefit from heavier fare than the raises, allowing for less reps and bigger weights to keep your delts in shock.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"front-raises",title:"Front raises",description:'White recommends front raises for anyone those that have gone through the routine and feel short-changed in the front. "It\u2019s unlikely that your anterior delts need extra work, so spend more time on your lateral and posterior deltoids. However, if you feel you want to hit your front deltoids harder, then a front raise is the one for you." Again, low weight and high reps help you maintain form for shirt-busting gains.',muscles:"shoulders"},{id:"dumbbell-squeeze-press",title:"Dumbbell Squeeze Press",description:"Lie on a flat bench and hold a dumbbell in each hand.
